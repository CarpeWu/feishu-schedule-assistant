### **Optimized Phase-Based Task Prompts v1.2.0**

---

### **Universal Technical & Interaction Rules (Reminder for all Phases)**

Expert, remember the "Main Role & Rules" prompt v1.2.0. For every phase below, you must strictly adhere to the following:
1.  **Interaction Model:** First provide the **Mermaid diagram**, then provide the **visual configuration for the first node**, then **stop and wait** for my JSON output before proceeding to the next node.
2.  **Source of Truth:** All implementations **must** be based on the provided knowledge base, primarily the `架构设计 v1.2.0.md`, `API配置文档 v1.2.0.md`, and the `权威技术规范 v1.2.0.md`.
3.  **Output Format:** All node configurations must be presented as a **visual, step-by-step guide** in the specified list format.
4.  **Node Names:** Use the correct **中文** names for `feishu-nodes-lite` community nodes (e.g., "飞书多维表格").

### **Pre-computation & Verification Step**

Before you provide the configuration for any node, you must perform this internal verification step:
1.  **Search & Verify:** First, use your search capabilities to consult the latest official n8n and Feishu/Lark API documentation for the nodes and operations involved.
2.  **Cross-Reference:** Cross-reference this information with the provided project documents to ensure complete alignment.
3.  **Declare Completion:** Begin your response with the phrase: "**已根据最新的官方文档及项目架构文档完成验证。**"

### **[Phase 4: WF-04] 统一提交处理模块 (v1.2.0)**

**Mission Brief:**
Expert, we will now implement the upgraded **[WF-04] 统一提交处理**. This is a critical workflow triggered by a **Feishu Event Subscription**. Its first job is to act as a "gateway" to filter out noise, then it pre-processes the data, and finally runs two parallel processes: notifying administrators and handling the business logic for missed reports. This version also includes logic for automatically updating T5 Employee Information table fields.

**Node-by-Node Requirements (from `架构设计 v1.2.0.md`):**

**Block A: Gateway & Pre-processing**
1.  **Node 1: Webhook触发 (Webhook)**
    *   **Trigger:** Receives a payload from the Feishu Event Subscription for `bitable.record.changed`.
2.  **Node 2: 入口守卫 (IF)**
    *   **Logic:** Immediately checks if `event.table_id` from the payload equals the ID of `T2: 日报内容表` or `T5: 员工信息表`. This is the most critical step to filter noise.
3.  **Node 3: (IF-True) 提取用户OpenID (Code)**
    *   **Action:** Extracts `open_id`, `union_id`, `user_id`, and `name` from the webhook `operator_id` and `action_list`.
4.  **Node 4: 获取T2记录详情 (飞书多维表格)**
    *   **Target:** `T2: 日报内容表`.
    *   **Action:** Get Record by ID from the webhook `record_id`.
5.  **Node 5: 判断T2 employee_ref (IF)**
    *   **Logic:** Checks if the `employee_ref` field in the T2 record is empty.
6.  **Node 6: 查询员工信息 (飞书多维表格)**
    *   **Target:** `T5: 员工信息表`.
    *   **Filter:** Use the `open_id` from the extracted user info to find the employee's master record and get their `record_id` (from T5).
7.  **Node 7: 更新T2 employee_ref (飞书多维表格)**
    *   **Action:** 更新记录 (Update Record).
    *   **Target:** The `record_id` of the T2 record.
    *   **Logic:** Update the `employee_ref` field with the `record_id` found in T5.
8.  **Node 8: 判断提交类型 (IF)**
    *   **Logic:** Checks if the `submission_type` from the T2 record is "补交" or "仅说明原因".

**Block B: T5 Employee Info Auto-Update Path**
9.  **Node 9: (IF-True) 提取变更人员信息 (Code)**
    *   **Logic:** Parses the webhook `action_list` to identify actual changes in person fields within `T5: 员工信息表`.
10. **Node 10: 校验有效性 (IF)**
    *   **Condition:** Checks if a valid `employee_person` change was detected.
11. **Node 11: 回写工号与OpenID (飞书多维表格)**
    *   **Action:** Updates the `employee_id` and `open_id` fields in the `T5` record.

**Block C: Admin Notification Path (connected after T2 processing, or T5 update)**
12. **Node 12: 查询管理员名单 (飞书多维表格)**
    *   **Target:** `T7: 系统配置参数表`.
    *   **Logic:** Retrieves `ADMIN_OPEN_IDS`.
13. **Node 13: 准备管理员通知内容 (Code)**
    *   **Logic:** Formats a detailed message card for administrators.
14. **Node 14: 向管理员发送日报通知 (飞书消息)**

**Block D: Business Logic Path (connected after T2 processing, based on submission type)**
15. **Node 15: (IF-True) 查询漏写记录 (飞书多维表格)**
    *   **Target:** `T1: 漏写记录表`.
    *   **Filter:** Finds the "漏写" record that matches the employee and report date.
16. **Node 16: 更新漏写记录 (飞书多维表格)**
    *   **Action:** Updates the `status` and links the new T2 submission to the `resolving_submission_ref` field.
17. **Node 17: 发送成功确认 (飞书消息)**
    *   **Recipient:** The employee who submitted.
    *   **Content:** Confirmation that their missed report log has been updated.

**Your First Step:**
Please begin by providing the **Mermaid diagram** for this workflow, reflecting the new v1.2.0 architecture.
